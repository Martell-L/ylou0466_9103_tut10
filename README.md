## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

My project aims to incorporate Pixel Art as an imaging technique, inspired by the platformer game *Celeste*. This game features exquisitely crafted pixel art, with perfectly balanced color usage and lighting effects that create a visually stunning and layered appearance. Additionally, the sound effects in the game enhance the overall sensory experience, providing an excellent auditory and visual experience.

- **Pixel Art Application**: I plan to apply this pixel art style to my project, using an 8-bit style to reinterpret classic paintings. Considering the assignment requirements, pixel art can dynamically depict changes in lighting through alterations in color and gradient transitions.
- **Perlin Noise**: This technique can also use Perlin noise to generate more natural, coherent, and repetitive visual patterns, such as flames and starry skies.
- **Interactive Backgrounds**: Furthermore, it allows for interactive background adjustments based on user input, enhancing the overall interactivity of the visuals.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

I intend to use **Pixel Painter** to achieve this effect.

- **Pixel Painter**: It converts an image into a digital painting. Every frame, it selects a random pixel from the original image and draws a dot with that pixelâ€™s color, as described.
  
Additionally, **Image Palette** will be extremely useful.

- **Image Palette**: This sketch modifies the colors in an image to match a selected palette. With this code, I can change the scene's colors to simulate different times of the day, such as transitions from sunrise to sunset or from day to night.
